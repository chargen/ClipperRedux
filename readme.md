# Obsolete!

This fork is from clipper 5.1.6, the latest version (as of 2016-04-14) is version 6.1.3 - as such this fork is rather out of date! The majority of the implementation issues have been resolved in the official version of clipper so you should use that. Currently the best option seems to be [this nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Clipper/).

## ClipperRedux

A fork of [Clipper](http://www.angusj.com/delphi/clipper.php) with changes to improve C# code style. The original clipper was ported from another language into C# and it shows! This fork improves C# code style, fixes some small bugs and adds Code Contracts assertions to try and catch more bugs in the future.

The code in this repository is available on nuget as [ClipperRedux](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ClipperRedux/).
